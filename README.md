# Hands-On System Design & Microservices Architecture

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects exploring **system design, distributed systems, software architecture, and microservices**.
Each section demonstrates a specific concept through practical implementation rather than theory.

Technologies covered include:

* **Go (Golang)**
* **.NET**
* **Docker**
* **Kafka**
* **Redis**
* **ElasticSearch**
* **DDD & Clean Architecture**
* **Software Design Patterns**
